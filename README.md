<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Here is a personal project that came out of a real need. I have always had difficulty managing my personal finances and the applications out there are too complicated and too bureaucratic. With that in mind, I decided to create my own finance web app, taking advantage and learning together with [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat), it is still in development, but soon I think I will launch it as a product.:smile:

Soon it will be integrated with the my [REST API](https://github.com/sammarxz/monetto-api)

### Built With

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
